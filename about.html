                                video
                                game developed and published by Riot Games for Microsoft Windows and macOS. The game follows
                                a
                                freemium model and is supported by microtransactions, and was inspired by the Warcraft III:
                                The
                                Frozen Throne mod, Defense of the Ancients.
    
                                In League of Legends, players assume the role of an unseen "summoner" that controls a
                                "champion" with unique abilities and battle against a team of other players or
                                computer-controlled champions. The goal is usually to destroy the opposing team's "nexus", a
                                structure that lies at the heart of a base protected by defensive structures, although other
                                distinct game modes exist as well. Each League of Legends match is discrete, with all
                                champions
                                starting off fairly weak but increasing in strength by accumulating items and experience
                                over
                                the course of the game. The champions and setting blend a variety of elements, including
                                high fantasy, steampunk, and Lovecraftian horror.

                            <p class="text-white">League of Legends is a 3D, third-person multiplayer online battle arena
                                (MOBA) game. The game consists of three current running game modes: Summoner's Rift,
                                Twisted Treeline, and Howling Abyss. Another game mode, The Crystal Scar, has since been
                                removed. Players compete in matches, lasting anywhere from 20 to 60 minutes on average. In
                                each game mode, teams work together to achieve a victory condition, typically destroying the
                                core building (called the Nexus) in the enemy team's base after bypassing a line of
                                defensive
                                structures called turrets, or towers.
    
                                In all game modes, players control characters called champions, chosen or assigned every
                                match,
                                who each have a set of unique abilities. Champions begin every match at a low level, and
                                then gain experience over the course of the match to achieve a maximum level of 18. Gaining
                                champion levels in matches allows players to unlock their champion's special abilities and
                                augment them in a number of ways unique to each character. If a champion loses all their
                                health, they are defeated, but are automatically revived in their base after enough time
                                passes. Players also begin each match with a low amount of gold, and can earn additional
                                gold
                                throughout the match in a variety of ways: by killing non-player characters known as minions
                                and monsters; by killing or helping to kill enemy players; by destroying enemy structures;
                                passively over time; and through unique item interactions or champion abilities. This gold
                                can
                                then be spent throughout the match to buy in-game items that further augment each champion's
                                abilities and game play in a variety of ways. Champion experience, gold earned, and items
                                bought are specific to each match and do not carry over to subsequent matches. Thus, all
                                players begin each match on more-or-less equal footing relative to their opposing team.

                            <p class="text-white">The game's developer, Riot Games, was co-founded by Brandon "Ryze" Beck and
                                Marc "Tryndamere" Merrill, who were roommates while they attended the University of Southern
                                California. They partnered with Steve "Guinsoo" Feak, the previous designer of the popular
                                Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne custom map Defense of the Ancients, and Steve "Pendragon"
                                Mescon, the administrator of the former official support base for the map, to develop League
                                of
                                Legends.
    
                                The original inspiration for "DotA" was a 1998 mod for StarCraft created by community member
                                Aeon64 called "Aeon of Strife". After the release of Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and its
                                subsequent World Editor in 2002, DotA was created by another modder, Eul. He ported and
                                expanded the "Aeon of Strife" mod to the new engine and named it "Defense of the Ancients".
                                Guinsoo later made DotA Allstars by inserting his own mix of content to "DotA", greatly
                                expanding the number of heroes, added recipes and items, and introduced various gameplay
                                changes. Guinsoo then passed the mod to IceFrog after accepting a job at the newly formed
                                Riot
                                Games.
