                                <p>Whether mistaken for a demon or god, many tales have been told of the Darkin Blade...
                                    but few
                                    know his real name, or the story of his fall.
                                    <br>
                                    In ancient times, long before desert sands swallowed the empire, a mighty champion
                                    of Shurima
                                    was brought before the Sun Disc to become the avatar for a now forgotten celestial
                                    ideal. Remade
                                    as one of the Ascended, his wings were the golden light of dawn, and his armor
                                    sparkled like a
                                    constellation of hope from beyond the great veil.
                                    <br>
                                    Aatrox was his name. He was at the vanguard of every noble conflict. So true and
                                    just was his
                                    conduct that other god-warriors would always gather at his side, and ten thousand
                                    mortals of
                                    Shurima marched behind him. When Setaka, the Ascended warrior-queen, called for his
                                    help against
                                    the rebellion of Icathia, Aatrox answered without hesitation.</p>

                                Vagabond and Great Caretaker only capture a fleeting aspect of his true purpose. When

                            recognition,
                            acclaim, and glory. He first sought greatness in the Noxian military, but his flair for the
                            dramatic went severely underappreciated. Thirsting for a method to share ''Draven'' with the
                            world, he turned his attention to the prison system. There he carved out the celebrity he
                            desired by turning the tedious affair of executions into a premiere spectacle.</p>

                    <h1>Gangplank</h1>
                    <p>As unpredictable as he is brutal, the dethroned reaver king known as Gangplank is feared far and
                        wide. Where he goes, death and ruin follow, and such is his infamy and reputation that the
                        merest sight of his black sails on the horizon causes panic among even the hardiest crew.
                        <br>
                        Having grown rich preying upon the trade routes of the Twelve Seas, Gangplank has made himself
                        many powerful enemies. In Ionia, he incurred the wrath of the deadly Order of Shadow after
                        ransacking the Temple of the Jagged Knife, and it is said that the Grand General of Noxus
                        himself has sworn to see Gangplank torn asunder after the pirate stole the Leviathan, Swain’s
                        personal warship and the pride of the Noxian fleet.
                        <br>
                        While Gangplank has incurred the wrath of many, none have yet been able to bring him to justice,
                        despite assassins, bounty hunters, and entire armadas being sent after him. He takes grim
                        pleasure in the ever-increasing rewards posted for his head, and makes sure to nail them to the
                        Bounty Board in Bilgewater for all to see whenever he returns to port, his ships heavy with
                        loot.</p>

                    <h1>Jinx</h1>
                    <p>While most look at Jinx and see only a mad woman wielding an array of dangerous weapons, a few
                        remember her as a relatively innocent girl from Zaun—a tinkerer with big ideas who never quite
                        fit in. No one knows for certain what happened to turn that sweet young child into a wildcard,
                        infamous for her wanton acts of destruction. But once Jinx exploded onto the scene in Piltover,
                        her unique talent for sowing anarchy instantly became the stuff of legend.
                        <br>
                        Jinx first gained notoriety through her anonymous “pranks” on the citizens of Piltover…
                        particularly those with connections to the wealthy merchant clans. These pranks ranged from the
                        moderately annoying to the criminally dangerous. She blocked streets on Progress Day, with a
                        stampede of exotic animals freed from Count Mei’s menagerie. She disrupted trade for weeks when
                        she lined the city’s iconic bridges with adorably destructive flame chompers. Once, she even
                        managed to move every street sign in town to new and utterly confusing locations.</p>

                    <h1>Kled</h1>
                    <p>The earliest known story of Kled traces back to the empire’s infancy and the Battle of Drugne. In
                        the dusty hills of those badlands, the First Legion was on the run from a barbarian horde.
                        Having lost the two previous battles, the men’s morale was low, the army had been forced to
                        abandon its supply train in the rout, and they were a week’s march from the nearest outpost.
                        <br>
                        In command of the Legion was a gaggle of wealthy nobles bedecked in spotless golden armor. They
                        were more concerned with their appearances and the intrigues of their class than the men they
                        were commanding. Worse, these commanders—though well versed in assassination and tournament
                        fighting—had proven hopeless on the field. With the remains of the army surrounded by enemy
                        forces, the nobles ordered the Legion into a defensive circle in hopes of negotiating ransoms
                        for themselves.
                        <br>
                        Then, as the morning sun rose, the mysterious figure of Kled appeared on the hilltop overlooking
                        the battlefield. He rode Skaarl, an immortal desert drakalops. The mount stood on only two legs;
                        its ear-like forelimbs fanned from the side of its head, hanging down apologetically, like a
                        butler who had accidently dipped his hands in soup.</p>

                    <h1>Lucian</h1>
                    <p>Lucian wields relic weapons imbued with ancient power and stands a stalwart guardian against the
                        undead. His cold conviction never wavers, even in the face of the maddening horrors he destroys
                        beneath his hail of purifying fire. Lucian walks alone on a grim mission: to purge the spirits
                        of those ensnared in undeath, his eternal beloved among them.
                        <br>
                        Like the twin relic weapons they wielded, Lucian and his wife Senna were carved from the same
                        stone. Together they battled evil in Runeterra for years, bringing light to darkness and purging
                        those taken by corruption. They were beacons of righteousness: Senna's dedication to their cause
                        never faltered, while Lucian's kindness and warmth touched the hearts of the many lives they
                        saved. Two parts of one whole, they were devoted and inseparable.</p>

                    <h1>Irelia</h1>
                    <p>Even as a small child, Xan Irelia was fascinated by the grace and beauty of human movement. Under
                        her grandmother’s tutelage, she learned the traditional silk dances of her province—though she
                        was dubious of their supposedly mystical connection to the Spirit of Ionia, Irelia’s love for
                        the dances was real. Seeking to master the art, she eventually left home to study with some of
                        Ionia’s most respected performers at the Placidium of Navori.
                        <br>
                        Irelia’s people were peaceful and sought harmony with their neighbors, but rumors of foreign
                        invaders sighted off the coast unsettled many at the Placidium. Irelia returned to her village
                        to find it already occupied, with steel-helmed soldiers from distant Noxus shoving unarmed
                        civilians through the streets with the butts of their spears. The Noxian Admiral Duqal had
                        seized the Xan home to quarter his fleet officers.
                        <br>
                        Irelia’s brothers and her father Lito had evidently protested; her entire family now lay in
                        unmarked graves, in the gardens.</p>

                    <h1>Pantheon</h1>
                    <p>Atreus was born on the hostile slopes of Targon, and named after a star in the constellation of
                        War, known as the Pantheon.
                        <br>
                        From an early age, he knew he was destined for battle. Like many in his tribe, he trained to
                        join the Rakkor’s militant order, the Ra’Horak. Never the strongest or the most skilled warrior,
                        Atreus somehow persevered, standing up, bloodied and bruised, after each bout. In time, he
                        developed a fierce rivalry with a fellow recruit, Pylas—but no matter how often Atreus was cast
                        onto the stones, he stood back up. Pylas was impressed by his unrelenting endurance, and through
                        the blood they spilled in the training circle, a true brotherhood was born.
                        <br>
                        Atreus and Pylas were among the Rakkor who stumbled across a barbarian incursion, surviving the
                        ambush that left the rest of their patrol dead. When the Aspect of the Sun refused to destroy
                        these trespassers, Atreus and Pylas swore to capture the power of the Aspects themselves by
                        climbing to the peak of Mount Targon.
                        <br>
                        Like so many before them, they underestimated how arduous the ascent would be, with Pylas
                        shivering his last upon finally reaching the summit. Only Atreus remained as the skies opened,
                        making him host to a divine Aspect, with the power to take revenge.</p>

                    <h1>Azir</h1>
                    <p>Azir was a mortal emperor of Shurima in a far distant age, a proud man who stood at the cusp of
                        immortality. His hubris saw him betrayed and murdered at the moment of his greatest triumph, but
                        now, millennia later, he has been reborn as an Ascended being of immense power. With his buried
                        city risen from the sand, Azir seeks to restore Shurima to its former glory.
                        <br>
                        Thousands of years ago, the Shuriman empire was a sprawling realm of vassal states conquered by
                        powerful armies led by all but invincible warriors known as the Ascended. Ruled by an ambitious
                        and power hungry emperor, Shurima was the greatest realm of its day; a fertile land blessed by
                        the power of the sun that shone from a great golden disc floating atop the temple at the heart
                        of its capital.
                        <br>
                        The youngest and least-favored son of the emperor, Azir was never destined for greatness. With
                        so many siblings ahead of him, he would never be emperor. Most likely he would take up a
                        position in the priesthood or as governor of some backwater province. He was a slender, studious
                        boy who spent more time perusing the texts collected in the Great Library of Nasus than training
                        to fight under the stern tutelage of the Ascended hero, Renekton.</p>
